The petal-collar slid from the frog’s throat like a pale canoe, drifting until it kissed the cedar’s bark.  
At the touch, the heron’s eye closed—one shutter on the moon—and the night itself seemed to inhale, tasting of iron and wet feathers. Along the bank every frog fell mute, throats swollen with a verdict that had not yet been spoken.

Where the petal met the trunk, the cedar softened; bark rippled like water, exhaled a faint citrus of crushed plum-blossom, and the heron’s sunken eye was drawn inward by a slow whirlpool. A single dusk-purple drop formed in the split wood, clung, and fell. It landed on the petal’s edge, blackening it as though inked by an unseen quill. Cold rose in a hush; the heron’s hidden eye began to glow—first ember-soft, then lantern-bright—casting a copper ring upon the water. Inside that ring the frogs’ reflections appeared, throats pulsing silently, each pulse peeling a moonlit layer from the surface and folding it into the cedar like pages turned by an absent wind.

Silas knelt at the ring’s edge. His fingers brushed the blackened petal; the stain crawled onto his skin, forming a rune that burned frost-cold. He did not flinch—he pressed the mark against the cedar’s split, offering the ache back to the tree.  
The cedar answered. A spore of green-gold pollen drifted into his pupils; tiny leaves unfurled along the rims of his irises, blinked, and vanished. His pulse slowed to the tree’s cadence—one beat every thirty-seven years—and the frost beneath his knee retreated, revealing soil that smelled of rain on old gravestones.

The trunk’s slow centuries poured through the breach in his eye. He tasted the iron settlers had buried beneath the roots, heard every axe that had ever tried to fell it, and each wound knit itself into the cartilage of his knee. Sap replaced blood; memory replaced breath. When the cedar’s heartwood cracked open, a rust-colored seed rolled out into his half-barked palm. A vow—not his own—rose through his throat like cold resin:  
“Three-and-thirty winters, you will guard the gate I become.”  
His tongue woodened; the words were the last human sound he would ever make.

Behind the frost-circle, Mara watched her father’s spine straighten, skin roughen to scaled bronze. She lifted the flint knife—its edge blackened by blood-oaths sworn before she was born—meaning to sever the joining before it hardened. But the ground exhaled; roots thin as sinew twined her ankles, asking, not forcing, her to stay. The knife trembled, caught the first flake of new snow, then slipped from her fingers and vanished into the drift.

She stepped over it, boots creaking, and knelt beside the fluted root. Her mittens brushed the bark where Silas’s name was still a green-gold bruise, warm as the last heat of his life. Beneath wool and wood she felt the tree’s heartbeat—centuries thick—matching the cadence she had once heard beneath his ribs during storms.  
The seed pulsed once, a heartbeat of green gold. Bark raced up Silas’s forearm like a tide; his last human eye closed as the cedar’s crown opened above him, needles fanning into a wind that smelled of snow and distant smoke. Between them a path of light narrowed to a trembling seam, stitching her grief to the living wood, each stitch a year she would walk without his stories.

Mara did not pick up the knife. She left it lying like a broken promise while the forest tilted, and the scent of smoke—no longer from hearths but from the burning of old choices—drifted between trunk and sky. The cedar leaned aside, or perhaps she did, until only the tree remained, solemn and unhurried, guarding the gate that had once been a man.
